# docassemble_embed

This is a Drupal 9 module that provides a block for embedding a
Docassemble guided interview into a Drupal 9 site.

It depends on the [Font Awesome Icons] module.

When installed, the Drupal "Configuration" will contain a "Docassemble
embed configuration" link under the "System" category.

When you go to "Structure" and then "Block layout," and you click
"Place block," one of the options will be "Docassemble interview
block."

A Drupal 8 version is available in the `drupal8` branch.

A Drupal 7 version, which only supports `<iframe>` embedding, is
available in the `drupal7` branch.

To download this module as a ZIP file, click the "Code" button and
choose "Download ZIP." This ZIP file can be uploaded to your Drupal
server.
